# A Ticket Management System using Spring Boot
Welcome to the Spring Boot Ticket Management System!
This repository showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through REST APIs.
Backed by a MySQL database, it efficiently stores and retrieves data.
Thorough unit tests validate the operations, while a Postman collection is provided for convenient API testing.

# Features
* CRUD Operations: REST endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE) manage tickets.
* MySQL Integration: Seamlessly connects to the MySQL database for data storage.
* Unit Tests: Comprehensive tests ensure the reliability of CRUD operations.
* Postman Collection: The included collection streamlines API testing.
